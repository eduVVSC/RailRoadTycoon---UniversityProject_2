# üöÇ Railroad Tycoon Project

This project aimed to apply a structured [Software Development Process (SDP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-development-process/) taught during the semester, while utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to develop a simulation game inspired by **Railroad Tycoon**.

The simulator includes two distinct user types:  
- **Editor**: Manages and configures simulation data.  
- **Player**: Interacts with and plays the simulation.

Each user type has a dedicated menu with functionalities relevant to their role.

## üìö Areas of Development

### üî¢ Math
The project incorporated concepts from:
- **Statistics**
- **Discrete Math**:
  - Graph creation, manipulation, and algorithm implementation
  - Matrix operations
  - Algorithm analysis

### üíª Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Interfaces and Abstraction
- Exception Handling
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### üß† Software Engineering
- GRASP principles
- Requirement gathering & analysis
- Software design and implementation
- Validation and testing of business rules
- DTOs and Mappers
- Managing Cohesion and Coupling
- Protected Variation and Adapter Patterns

### ü§ù Teamwork & Tools
- Version control with GitHub (branches, pull requests)
- Task management via GitHub Boards
- Communication through Discord
- Agile methodology: SCRUM & sprints

## üë§ My Responsibilities

1. **Requirements, Analysis, Design, and Implementation** of:
   - US001, US002, US012, US013, US026, US027
2. Definition of **Non-Functional Requirements**
3. Creation of **Use Case Diagram**
4. Development of **Class Diagrams** for assigned user stories
5. Creation of a **General Class Diagram**
6. **Project bootstrapping**: basic class creation, method declarations, program logic scaffolding
7. Design and implementation of **Map & Position Management**
8. Development of **Time Simulation Logic**
9. **Station Resource Management**: handling object interactions within range
10. **Industry Production Logic**
11. Complete **UI Design and Implementation** using **JavaFX**
12. Application of **Graph Algorithms** from Discrete Math

## üèÜ Achievements

We successfully delivered a **fully functional product** by the deadline, with:
- A polished and user-friendly **JavaFX UI**
- All modules operating as specified
- Efficient memory usage
- A complex yet smooth **simulation engine**

However, the library chosen for graph representation (used for connections between map objects and objects themselves) incurred significant performance cost.

---

## üîÑ What I Would Improve

1. Apply **polymorphism and interfaces** more effectively
2. Introduce **intentional redundancy** to reduce tight coupling
3. Optimize performance by **reducing texture quality**
4. Create **custom exceptions** for better error handling
5. Choose a **lighter, more efficient graphing library**

# Project Template

This project template contains didactic artifacts relevant to the Integrative Project to be developed during the second semester of the [Degree in Informatics Engineering (LEI)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26) from the [School of Engineering ‚Äì Polytechnic of Porto (ISEP)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt).

In particular, it has:

* The [Team Members and Task Distribution](docs/TeamMembersAndTasks.md) during sprints;
* [Templates](docs/(template-files)) to capture and systematize evidence of proper application of the Software Development Process, namely regarding the activities of Requirements Engineering, OO Analysis and Design;
* [Sample documentation](docs/outsourcing-tasks-example) and [source code](src) available as a starting point;
* General description of how the provided application works (and it is structured).


## Maven goals

### Run the unit tests
```
mvn clean test
```

### Generate javadoc for the source code
```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

### Generate javadoc for the test code
```
mvn javadoc:test-javadoc
```

### Generate Jacoco source code coverage report
```
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Check if thresholds limits are achieved
```
mvn test jacoco:check
```

## How to generate a Jar package for the project

Place the following plugin on the appropriate place of the pom.xml file.

```xml
