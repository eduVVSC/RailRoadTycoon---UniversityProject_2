## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

- In this user story, the player can view a list of all existing stations and select one to see its details. This includes the station's name, location, existing buildings, and the cargo supply and demand within its economic radius. 

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

#### From the specifications document:

> "When viewing a station, in addition to the buildings present, the cargo that is ready for collection and the cargo that needs to be delivered (as in the example) should also be displayed."

#### From the client clarifications:
> **Q:** When a telephone is purchased for a station, it replaces the telegraph. However, in the station's details, should the telegraph appear as inactive?
>
> **A:** No, the telephone completely replaces the telegraph. Once a telephone is purchased, the telegraph should no longer appear in the station's details at all.
