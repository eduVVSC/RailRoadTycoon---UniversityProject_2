### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* `Budget`
* `StationType`
* `Depot`
* `Station`
* `Terminal`
* `Map`
* `Location`
* `Position`
* `Buildings`
* `Scenario`


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* `StationRepostory`
* `UpgradeStationWithBuildingUI`
* `UpgradeStationWithBuildingController`
