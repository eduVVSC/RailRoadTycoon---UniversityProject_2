## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Product Owner, I want to conclude about the efficiency of  the above procedure, by analysing the worst-case time complexity.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

#### From specification document

#### From the client clarifications
> **Q:** 
>
> **A:** 

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC01**: The analysis report of the worst-case time complexity of the algorithms should be documented/detailed in the repository documentation (using markdown format). All the algorithms should be presented in pseudocode, where the complexity analysis should be made.
- **AC02**:  The procedure for the graphic visualization should be excluded from this analysis.
