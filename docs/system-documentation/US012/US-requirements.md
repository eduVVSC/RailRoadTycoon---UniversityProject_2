# US012 - As a Player, I want to create a simulator that generates cargoes at current stations, automatically, considering the cities and industries that the railway network serves. 

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Player, I want to create a simulator that generates cargoes at current stations, automatically, considering the cities and industries that the railway network serves in order to ease the managment of my station. I want to be implemented as well a button to start and stop the simulation.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
Nothing mentioned.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria
**AC1:** The simulation should be possible to be paused/played.
**AC2:** In order to generate cargo the station need to be connected to cities or industries.
**AC3:** Guarantee that the simulation is properly working with cargoes being automatically generated, taking into account cities and industries.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies
 - ![US001 - As a Editor, I wanna create a map](../US001) . The dependency in the map exist because the current station only exist if the map exists and is well set.
 - ![US002 - As an Editor, I want to add an industry in the map](../US002) . The dependency cames from the the need of existing industries to consume the cargo that will be delivered.
 - ![US003 - As an Editor, I want to add a city](../US003) . The dependency cames from the the need of existing cities to consume the cargo that will be delivered.
 - ![US007 - As a Player, I want to list all the stations to select one to see it's details](../US007) . The dependency cames from the need to see the connected stations to the current station in order to simulate the cargo.
 - ![US008 - As a Player, I want to build a railway between two stations.](../US008) . The dependency cames from the need of existing the connection between two or more station to calaculate the cargo to be delivered in another station.
 - ![US010 -As a Player, I want to assign a selected train to a route](../US010) . The dependency cames from being one of the interactions of the player with the simulation that generate money.
