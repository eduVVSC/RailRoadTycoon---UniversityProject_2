# OO Analysis

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_

**Business Transactions**

* **"Create Map"** : The **editor** is going to enter a name and a size for a bidimensional map.
* **"Add an industry"** : User as the **editor** is going to select which industry he was going to want to build from a list of possibilities, the type of product that it produces and is going to give position in which the industry should be in.
* **"Add a city"** : User as the **editor** is going to ..
* **"Create a scenario"** : User as the **editor** is going to..
* **"Build station"** : User as the **player** is going to..
* **"Upgrade station"** : User as the **player** is going to..
* **"List all stations"** : User as the **player** is going to..
* **"Build railway between stations"** : User as the **player** is going to..
* **"Buy a locomotive"** : User as the **player** is going to..
* **"Sign a train to a route"** : User as the **player** is going to..

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* 

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

* 

---

**Transaction Records**

* 

---  

**Roles of People or Organizations**

* **Editor** -> His role is to create the map and the scenario in which the simulation will take place.
* **Player** -> His role is to choose the scenario and map and play the simulation(manage the rail network, trains and cargoes).

---

**Places**

* **Cities**
* **Industries**
* **Stations**
* **Railroads**

---

**Noteworthy Events**

* **Change of time restrictions**, they will change the availability of some types of locomotives(for trains), type of products produced(industry) and buildings(to stations)
* **Change of historical restrictions**, they will control the variance of the demand for some products, changing also the price of them.
* **Change of behaviour of ports**, they affect the way the port behaves, which product it will export and import.
* **Technological restrictions**, they affect the type of tecnologies that can be implemented by the locomotives and by the industries

---

**Physical Objects**

* **Owned trains**
* **Cities in the map**
* **Stations in the map**
* **Industry in the map**
* **Cargoes**

---

**Descriptions of Things**

* 

---

**Catalogs**

* 

---

**Containers**

* **Carriage**
* **Cargo**
* **Silo**(upgrade building to station)

---

**Elements of Containers**

* **Elements of Carriage**: cargo
* **Elements of Cargo**: produced itens from the industries, passagers and mail
* **Elements of Silo**: Stores wool, vegetables and coffee

---

**(Other) Organizations**

* None

---

**Other (External/Collaborating) Systems**

* None

---

**Records of finance, work, contracts, legal matters**

* None

---

**Financial Instruments**

* None

---

**Documents mentioned/used to perform some work**

* None

---


## Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

* **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
* **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
* **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
* **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
* **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
* **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
* etc.
