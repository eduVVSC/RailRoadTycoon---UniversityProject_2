| Adapter | Adaptador | A component that acts as a bridge between our system and an external module by converting system-specific requests into the format required by the external API. Each external module requires its own adapter to handle these conversions. |
| Adjacency Matrix | Matrix de Adjacências | Is a square matrix used to represent a graph, where each element indicates whether a pair of vertices is connected by an edge. For a graph with n vertices, the adjacency matrix is an n×n matrix M where the entry M(ij)​ represents the number of edges from vertex i to vertex j. In simple graphs, the entries are 0 or 1, but in multigraphs, the entries can be greater than 1 to reflect multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. In undirected graphs, the matrix is symmetric. |
| Admin | Administrador | Is responsible for adding other users. |
| Aggregation | Agregação | Aggregation is a type of association where one class owns or is composed of other classes, but the child objects can exist independently of the parent. For example a Class and a Student. If the Class is deleted, the Student still exists. |
| Association | Associação | An association is a relationship between classes that represents a meaningful, lasting connection, indicating which objects need to remember their link to each other over time. For example, a Teacher and a Student, where each needs to know about the other during a course. |
| Asymptotic behavior | Comportamento assintótico | Describes how the running time or space requirements of an algorithm grow relative to the input size, particularly as the input becomes very large. This concept allows focusing on the dominant factors that affect performance, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms |
| Authentication | Autenticação | The act to log in as a User; Editor or Admin. This requires a username and password |
| Automatic event | Evento automático | The software's autonomous event that generates cargo (mail; passengers; coal; etc...) |
| Budget | Dinheiro | The total amount of money allocated to the player for building and managing railway infrastructure, such as stations, railway lines, and upgrades. It defines the financial resources available for these activities. |
| Buildings | Construções | Structures that increase the station's performance, improve train operations, facilitate train maneuvers, and extend the lifespan of cargo stored at the station. Some of these buildings include the telegraph (later replaced by the telephone), café (small or large), customs office, post office, hotel (small or large), silo, and liquid storage facility. Each building contributes to optimizing the station's functionality and efficiency. |
| Cardinal Position | Posição Cardinal | A directional indicator — NE (northeast), SE (southeast), SW (southwest), NW (northwest) — that defines how the influence area of a station expands around its fixed geometric center. While the station is always positioned with its center at a specific point (e.g., 0,0), the cardinal position determines in which quadrant the area of influence extends from that point. This affects which surrounding tiles are covered by the station for purposes such as cargo pickup, delivery, and interaction with nearby industries or cities. |
| Cargo | Carga | Any type of goods or materials being transported, including raw materials, intermediate products, finished products, passengers, and mail, that are moved between stations, industries, and ports within the simulation. |
| City | Cidade | A populated area with a name, coordinates, and housing blocks. Cities generate and consume passengers, mail, and final products. |
| Coefficient of determination | Coeficiente de determinação | A statistical metric, usually denoted as R^2, that indicates how much of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the model perfectly explains the data, and 0 means it explains nothing. Is directly tied to the predictive power of the model and is typically used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression curve. |
| Composition | Composition | Composition is a stronger form of association where the parent class owns the child objects, and the child cannot exist without the parent.For example a House and a Room. If the House is deleted, the Room no longer exists. |
| Confidence intervals | Intervalos de confiança | A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true value of an unknown population parameter (such as a mean or proportion). It is associated with a confidence level, typically 95% or 99%, which indicates how confident we are that the interval includes the true value. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we repeated the sampling process many times, approximately 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the actual population parameter |
| Connected Undirected Graph | Grafo Conexo Não Direcionado | An undirected graph is considered connected if, for every pair of vertices in the graph, there exists at least one path that links them. A path is a sequence of edges and vertices where each edge connects two vertices, allowing you to "travel" from one vertex to the other by following these edges without lifting your pen. This means that starting at any vertex, you can reach any other vertex in the graph by moving along the edges. |

By preventing direct UI-to-domain communication, it ensures low coupling and separation of concerns, enabling reuse and support for multiple interfaces. |
| Creator | Criador | Guides which class should be responsible for creating a new object. Typically, class B should create instances of class A if B contains or aggregates A, records A, closely uses A, or has the data needed to initialize A. Assigning creation responsibility this way helps maintain clear relationships but increases coupling between classes. In complex creation scenarios, object creation may be delegated using patterns like Abstract Factory or Builder |
| CSS | CSS | Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation (layout, colors, fonts, etc.) of a document written in HTML or XML.

| Curve fitting | Ajuste de curva | A statistical technique that finds a mathematical function that best represents the relationship between variables in a dataset. It is often used to approximate the behavior of algorithms based on empirical data by fitting curves to measured running times. |
| Demand | Demanda | Represents how much a station needs or desires a specific type of cargo. It determines how valuable a delivery of that cargo will be at that location. Stations with higher demand level will pay more for deliveries, while stations with lower demand level will pay less. |
| Demand Level | Nivel da Demanda | The demand level is a numeric representation of how strongly a station desires a specific cargo. It ranges from 0 to 9. A demand level of 5 is considered the base level, where the station pays the standard (base) value for a cargo delivery. For each level above or below 5, the payment is adjusted by 20%. For example, a demand level of 8 means the station will pay 60% more than the base value, while a demand level of 3 means the station will pay 40% less. If the demand is 0, the station does not accept that cargo at all. The demand level is dynamic and changes based on how much cargo is delivered during the year. |
| Depot | Depot | A small station with an influence area of 3x3 and a cost of 50k. |
| Dijkstra's Algorithm | Algoritmo de Dijkstra | Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest simple path between two vertices in an undirected, connected graph with positive edge weights. Given a start vertex A and an end vertex Z, the algorithm assigns a permanent label of 0 to A and temporary labels of infinity to all other vertices. It then iteratively selects the temporary vertex with the smallest label, updates the labels of its neighboring vertices based on the edge weights, and marks the selected vertex's label as permanent. This process continues until the end vertex Z is assigned a permanent label. The algorithm returns the minimum cost to reach Z from A, as well as the shortest path, which can be reconstructed by tracing back through the predecessor vertices recorded during the label updates. |
| DTO | DTO | A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a simple container for data used to transfer information between system layers with low coupling. It holds no business logic and usually has public attributes. DTOs improve modularity and maintainability by decoupling components, often converted from domain objects by a Mapper.

| Fleury's algorithm | Algoritmo de Fleury | An algorithm used to find an Eulerian path or Eulerian circuit in a graph, which is a path or cycle that visits every edge exactly once. The algorithm requires the graph to be connected (except possibly for isolated vertices) and to satisfy the necessary conditions for an Eulerian path or circuit (i.e., all vertices have even degree for a circuit, or exactly two vertices have odd degree for a path). It proceeds by traversing edges one by one, always choosing an edge that is not a bridge (an edge whose removal would disconnect the graph), unless no alternative edges are available. This ensures the path covers all edges without getting stuck prematurely. |

The main goal of GRASP is to help developers understand the fundamentals of object design and to apply design reasoning in a systematic, rational, and understandable way. It provides clear guidelines for making well-founded design decisions, promoting cohesion, flexibility, and maintainability in software systems. |
| High cohesion | Alta coesão | High cohesion is a design principle that ensures a class or object has a focused and related set of responsibilities, making it easier to understand and maintain.

| Pearson correlation coefficient | Coeficiente de Correlação de Pearson | The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. A value of r equal to 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other also increases proportionally. A value of r equal to -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, where one variable increases as the other decreases proportionally. A value of r equal to 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables, meaning that changes in one variable do not predict changes in the other linearly. |

| Polymorphism | Polimorfismo | Is a design principle that handles alternatives based on object types by assigning behaviors to polymorphic methods rather than using type-based conditional logic. It enables software components to be easily extended and maintained by allowing different classes to implement the same interface or method with their own behavior. This reduces code complexity, improves flexibility, and simplifies adding new variations without modifying existing code. |
